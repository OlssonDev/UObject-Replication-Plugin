# UObject Replication Plugin

UObject Replication Plugin is a plugin for Unreal Engine 5. It enables projects to replicate UObjects over the network in Blueprints, which is not supported by default due to C++ setup. The plugin will replicate your UObjects simply as replicating an Actor/Actor Component.
